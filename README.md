## Mission
The goal of this project was to create working MVC with at least 3 tables and foreign key relationship.
I have created 5 tables with two being joining tables with One To Many relationships.

## Description
ManaMart is supposed to act as a custom deck ordering site for a local game store. Users register accounts to create their cards and add them to their own decks. customers can create orders and add their decks to said order that an admin can view and put together.

- Data: This layer houses your classes that relate to the DB (POCOs, Identity, etc)
- Models: This layer houses the reusable models for the rest of the layers
